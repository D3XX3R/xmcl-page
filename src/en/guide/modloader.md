# What is modloader and why I need that

Minecraft mod loaders are essential tools that empower both players and mod developers to extend and enrich the game.

Whether you want to add realistic shader effects that completely transform the look of your world or achieve those epic, far-reaching views seen in viral TikTok and YouTube clips, a mod loader is your gateway to creative enhancements.

For example, if you'd like to install a shader mod like Sildur's Shaders for lifelike lighting effects, or add the "Distant Horizons" mod to see extended vistas in your Minecraft world, you'll need a mod loader such as Fabric or Forge to handle these modifications.

**Well, maybe you won't struggle very much on choosing the modloader, your mods make the choice...**

In this document, we will explore four popular mod loaders: **Minecraft Forge**, **Fabric**, **NeoForge**, and **Quilt**. Each offers its own set of features and benefits, catering to different modding needs and performance preferences.

**Overview:**

- The original and battle-tested mod loader for Minecraft.
- Offers extensive community support and a mature ecosystem.
- Provides a robust API, making it ideal for comprehensive mod packs and mods with deep game integrations.

**Key Features:**

- **Mature Ecosystem:** Years of development have resulted in abundant documentation, tutorials, and community resources.
- **Deep API Integration:** Forge’s comprehensive API enables detailed interactions with Minecraft, ideal for mods that modify core functionalities.
- **Broad Compatibility:** Many popular mods and extensive mod packs are built for Forge, ensuring wide-ranging compatibility.

**Considerations:**

- **Update Lag:** Forge can sometimes take longer to update to the latest Minecraft versions.
- **Resource Overhead:** Its extensive feature set may result in longer load times compared to more streamlined loaders.

## Fabric

**Overview:**

- A lightweight, modular mod loader designed for modern Minecraft versions.
- Favored by developers and players who prioritize fast performance and rapid updates.
- Particularly suited for mods that boost graphics performance, such as shader mods or those that extend view distances.

**Key Features:**

- **Performance-Oriented:** Its streamlined design minimizes overhead, leading to swift load times – perfect for mods that enhance visual effects.
- **Rapid Updates:** Fabric’s modular structure allows it to quickly adapt to new Minecraft versions.
- **Developer Flexibility:** The simple yet powerful API encourages rapid experimentation and iteration.

**Example Use Case:**

- **Epic Vistas:** If you want to install a mod like "Distant Horizons" for dramatically extended view distances—as seen in many popular online clips—Fabric is an excellent choice.
- **Enhanced Visuals:** Similarly, adding shader mods for realistic lighting and shadow effects becomes a breeze with Fabric’s optimized loader.

**Considerations:**

- **Growing Library:** While its community is rapidly expanding, Fabric's mod repository is still catching up to the extensive offerings found on Forge.
- **Limited Backward Support:** Designed primarily for modern Minecraft versions, meaning older mods might not be supported.

## NeoForge

<AppNeoForgePicture />

**Overview:**

- A rising mod loader that aims to blend Forge’s comprehensive compatibility with modern performance optimizations.
- Targeted at players seeking a balanced approach between traditional functionality and streamlined performance.

**Key Features:**

- **Hybrid Approach:** Combines many of Forge's robust features with modern performance tweaks.
- **Modern Codebase:** Built with current modding practices in mind while still providing legacy support.
- **Community-Driven:** Continuously evolving, with improvements driven directly by user and developer feedback.

**Considerations:**

- **Early Stage:** As an emerging tool, NeoForge might not yet offer the same breadth of supported mods or the polished documentation found in older loaders.
- **Evolving Ecosystem:** Its community and mod library will continue to grow over time, potentially with some initial growing pains.

## Quilt

**Overview:**

- A fork of Fabric that expands upon its lightweight foundation by introducing enhanced features and additional improvements.
- Developed in response to community needs, Quilt aims to refine and expand the mod loading experience.

**Key Features:**

- **Enhanced Functionality:** Offers additional APIs and tools that unlock more creative possibilities for modders.
- **Community-Driven Innovation:** Quilt is designed with the modern modder in mind, providing both rapid updates and innovative features.
- **Seamless Integration:** Initially supporting Fabric mods, Quilt is gradually forging its own unique ecosystem.

**Considerations:**

- **Active Development:** Quilt is still in its early development phase, so users might encounter occasional instabilities.
- **Transition Period:** While it starts by leveraging Fabric’s benefits, Quilt is evolving into an independent platform with its own advantages.
